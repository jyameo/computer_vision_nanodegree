# Computer Vision / Deep Learning
## This repo contains various deep learning architectures (and notebooks) for solving common computer vision problems:

1. CNN: Facial Keypoint Detection
2. RNN: Image Captioning 
3. Landmark Detection and Tracking


**Pytorch** was used to train the models in this repo
