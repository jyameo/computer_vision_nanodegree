# Computer Vision / Deep Learning

## This repo contains various deep learning architectures (and notebooks) for solving common computer vision problems:

1. CNN: Facial Keypoint Detection
2. RNN: Image Captioning 
3. Landmark Detection and Tracking


**Pytorch** was used to train the models in this repo

This architecture was inspired by the following paper: [Facial Key Points Detection using Deep Convolutional 
Neural Network - NaimishNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00977)
